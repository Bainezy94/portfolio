##Description

###Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio is to showcase the work I have completed and present this in a professional format to potential future employers.

###Functionality/Features
I attempt to use Microanimations where possible to make the user not have to think. This includes hover effects on clickable items, Nav links scroll page into view and nav links show the current page the user has scrolled to.

###Design Process

I chose to go with a dark theme using a dark background. The priamry colour used for fonts is the darkest shade of gray that is still ledgible on the dark background according to the Webaim guidelines.

I then added elements of colour on each page to bring attention to these elements. The colours used for the Brand icons are a combination of brands own colour and a shadowing of the brands colour ~15% darker.

The theme that I was going for was "A Modern Barbershop in France."
